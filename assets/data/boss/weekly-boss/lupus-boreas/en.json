    "description": "The noblest and greatest of souls, who watches over the lupical of Wolvendom.\nWhen the wolfpack is imperiled, it will emerge in the form of a wolf and show forth its fangs and claws.\n\nThe wolves of Wolvendom are frightening phantoms to the people of Mondstadt:\nA blurred shape flashing through the forest, a chilling howl in the indeterminate distance, the creeping sense of eyes constantly nailed on their backs...\nHumans rarely have the oppotunity to lock their eyes with a wolf, for this is the law Lupus Boreas laid down for its race.",
