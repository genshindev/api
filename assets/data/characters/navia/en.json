The more Rosula Shardshots that strike a single opponent, the greater the DMG dealt to them. When all 11 Rosula Shardshots strike, 200% of the original amount of DMG is dealt.\nIn addition, when more than 3 stacks of Crystal Shrapnel are consumed, every stack consumed beyond those 3 will increase the DMG dealt by this Gunbrella attack by an additional 15%.\nHold\nEnter Aiming Mode, continually collecting nearby Elemental Shards created by Crystallize reactions.
