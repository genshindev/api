This effect can be triggered once on each opponent every 0.5s.\nWhen in this state, Kirara's movement speed, climbing speed, and jumping power are all increased, and her Stamina Consumption from climbing is increased.\nWhen the duration ends or the skill is used again, a Flipclaw Strike more powerful than the attack in the Press Mode will be unleashed, dealing AoE Dendro DMG.\nThe Urgent Neko Parcel state lasts a maximum of 10s. When the state ends, the skill will enter CD. The longer Kirara spends in this state, the longer the CD will be.\nSprinting or actively canceling climbing will end this state early.\n\"So you wanna know the secret to speedy deliveries?
