If you unleash this ability only after reaching Finisher Frame, you will instead apply Focused Impression, which lasts longer and deals more DMG, although the Skill CD will be longer.\nComposition Mode lasts a maximum of 15s and allows a maximum of 5 opponents to be selected.\n\"Press photography requires simple shots with exceptional theming, but most of all, you need to have a knack for capturing the moment!\"",
