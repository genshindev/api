During this effect's duration, it will deal Cryo DMG to affected opponents at intervals.\nHold\nPopping Monsieur Verite's viewfinder open, Charlotte enters Composition Mode, and during this time, the viewfinder will expand as you hold until you reach a Finisher Frame state. In this state, Charlotte can move and change direction freely.\nWhen the hold state ends, Monsieur Verite will deal Cryo DMG to all opponents locked on within the viewfinder, and apply the same Snappy Silhouette as Tap Mode does to them. If you unleash this ability only after reaching Finisher Frame, you will instead apply Focused Impression, which lasts longer and deals more DMG, although the Skill CD will be longer.\nComposition Mode lasts a maximum of 15s and allows a maximum of 5 opponents to be selected.\n\"Press photography requires simple shots with exceptional theming, but most of all, you need to have a knack for capturing the moment!\"",
