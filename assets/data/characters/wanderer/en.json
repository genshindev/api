Kuugo: Toufukai will not consume Stamina. The Wanderer will hover persistently during this time. While this state is active, the Wanderer's movements gain the following properties:\n- Persistently consumes Kuugoryoku Points to maintain this hovering state.\n- When sprinting, additional Kuugoryoku Points will be consumed for the Wanderer to accelerate mid-air. Holding sprint will cause persistent Kuugoryoku Point consumption to maintain speed. This effect will replace his default sprint.\n- Jumping expends extra Kuugoryoku Points to increase hovering height.
