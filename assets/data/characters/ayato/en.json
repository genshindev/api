This cannot be overridden. It also has the following properties:\nAfter a Shunsuiken attack hits an opponent, it will grant Ayato the Namisen effect, increasing the DMG dealt by Shunsuiken based on Ayato's current Max HP. The initial maximum number of Namisen stacks is 4, and 1 stack can be gained through Shunsuiken every 0.1s. This effect will be dispelled when Takimeguri Kanka ends.\nKamisato Ayato's resistance to interruption is increased.\nUnable to use Charged or Plunging Attacks.\nTakimeguri Kanka will be cleared when Ayato leaves the field.
